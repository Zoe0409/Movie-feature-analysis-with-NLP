    "We all love watching movies! There are some movies we like, some we don't. Most people have a preference for movies of a similar genre. Some of us love watching action movies, while some of us like watching horror. Some of us like watching movies that have ninjas in them, while some of us like watching superheroes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Movies within a genre often share common base parameters. For example, both movies, Toy stories and The lion king, are movies for kids and they indeed share many similarities. We could conclude that both of these fall into the same genre of movies based on intuition, but that's no fun in a data science context. In this project, we will quantify the similarity of movies based on their plot summaries available on IMDb, then separate them into groups, also known as clusters. \n",

Each iteration of a new random sample from the dataset is obtained and used to update the clusters and this is repeated until convergence. Each mini batch updates the clusters using a convex combination of the values of the prototypes and the data, applying a learning rate that decreases with the number of iterations. This learning rate is the inverse of the number of data assigned to a cluster during the process. As the number of iterations increases, the effect of new data is reduced, so convergence can be detected when no changes in the clusters occur in several consecutive iterations.\n",
